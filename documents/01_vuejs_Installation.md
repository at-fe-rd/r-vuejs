Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. 
They can work in only html files or in project by vue cli.
## Basic in HTML
### Installation
- In HTML, Just add this line into the html to import the vue library: 
  `<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>`
-   In Vue CLI, open Terminal and type those commands

    ```
    # install vue-cli

    $ npm install --global vue-cli

    # create a new project using the "webpack" template

    $ vue init webpack my-project

    # install dependencies and go!

    $ cd my-project

    $ npm install

    $ npm run dev
    ```

    - In above commands, we use "webpack" template to create a Vue project.

    - We also create another types of Vue project by using another templates.
